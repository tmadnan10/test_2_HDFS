OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: You have loaded library /root/ephemeral-hdfs/lib/native/libhadoop.so.1.0.0 which might have disabled stack guard. The VM will try to fix the stack guard now.
It's highly recommended that you fix the library with 'execstack -c <libfile>', or link it with '-z noexecstack'.
